# What is Advent of Code?

For the last 5 years, [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) has been offering a fun, daily coding challenge with a holiday-based theme. A new puzzle is released Midnight EST/UTC-5 from the 1st of December to the 25th, with the plain-language requirements thoughtfully included into the story of the year. This year we are going on a vacation after saving the season 4 times already! The problems are language-agnostic and often include example data and plain-language requirements, which you then need to solve programmatically. 

While this is not ServiceNow specific, I love taking part to test my coding ability, find new ways of solving problems and compete (in a friendly manner!) with fellow developers. Some problems ([Like this one](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/7)) could even lend themselves to a relational database structure, which could be modelled in ServiceNow!

# Awesome! How do I join in?

There is a global leaderboard, and you can create private ones to share with friends too! Over on [SN Devs Slack](https://sndevs.com/invite) we have created a channel (**#advent-of-code**) and a [Private Leaderboard](https://adventofcode.com/2020/leaderboard/private/view/680037) to track our progress. As of writing, I'm in second place! I need to up my game!

There's also a thriving [Reddit community](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/), where people post amazing visualizations of the problems, and you are always encouraged to upload your examples to GitHub! [Here's Mine](https://github.com/dorsy99/advent-of-code-2020/)!


# So that's it?

Yep! Get out there and get coding! It's not like we have much else to do during a pandemic, right?
